You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Usage

1. This project contains two pages i.e. HomePage and AboutPage, initial routing is done for HomePage.

2. We can click on buttons and links both in HomePage and AboutPage respectively.

3. We can redirect from HomePage to AboutPage and viceverse.

4. There are links on both the pages, which re-directs to external pages

5. For scalability & optimisation of data, we have used redux as a centralized data management tool, so that if the user traffic increses the app would handle it accordinlgy.

6. The click events, redirection of pages and page vistis are tracked using redux.

7. The data collected is send to api endpoints for performance optimisation and further analysis.
